# Project 01 - Drawing with CSS

The project consists on analyzing and deconstructing an abstract painting or illustration and recreating it with code. We will dissect a painting and select a few key elements. Then we will draw these shapes and recreate them with code.

> Analyze, Sketch, Code



## Project: Drawing art with CSS

1. Find an abstract artist/painting
2. Crop it into a square
3. Trace it with [geometric primitives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_primitive) using vector drawing software (Sketch, Illustrator)
4. Name and group each shape logically
5. Use the color picker to match each shape's color
6. Recreate each shape in CSS (size, color, border)
7. Arrange the shapes into position using CSS
